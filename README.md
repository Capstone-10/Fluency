# Capstone | Fluency

_Mobile translation app for daily use._

Created by a team of four developers during the Software Engineering program at [Fullstack Academy](https://www.fullstackacademy.com), Fluency is a React Native app that allows users to capture image text or manually type text, and translate it into a language of choice. The application can further read aloud your translated text.

It was exciting to build a native iOS application, and learn the syntax to fetch the Google APIs. We learned a lot about the complexities of rendering a functional and user-friendly phone application without a database. We enjoyed this learning process, and are happy to have you try out the application.
